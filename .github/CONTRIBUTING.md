## Working in the Vue Unicorn Log repository
Here's some information that might be helpful while working on a Vue Unicorn Log PR:

<!-- - [Development](/contributing/development.md) - This short guide describes how to get this app running on your local machine. -->

## Reviewing
We (usually the Vue Unicorn Log team) review every single PR. The purpose of reviews is to create the best content we can for people who use GitHub.

- Reviews are always respectful, acknowledging that everyone did the best possible job with the knowledge they had at the time.  
- Reviews discuss content, not the person who created it.  
- Reviews are constructive and start conversation around feedback.  

### Self review
You should always review your own PR first.

<!-- ### Pull request template
When you open a pull request, you must fill out the "Ready for review" template before we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes and the purpose of your pull request. -->

### Suggested changes
We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
